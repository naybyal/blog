It's Friday the 13th, and I have decided to seriously explore data structures and algorithms, starting today. I am not driven by the desire to get placed in big tech but rather, I am on a pursuit to become a better developer who understands the internals of operating systems, databases, and everything low-level.

I have decided to tackle arrays and strings first, using Java as the programming language. This will not be basic, as I already know the fundamentals of arrays and strings. This time, I want to take things up a notch by solving more problems to deepen my understanding and improve my implementation of concepts like StringBuilder, HashMap, and others.

Whenever we need a data structure to store key-value pairs for extremely efficient lookups, the first thing that comes to my mind is a **hash map**.

*"Wait a minute, Nabiel. You said you were going to start with hash tables!"*

Allow me to explain. From what I've understood, **HashTable** and **HashMap** in Java differ in the following ways:

1. **HashTable is synchronized**, which makes it better suited for multithreaded applications.

>    #### What do you mean by "synchronized"?  
>    -  By "synchronized", I mean that multiple threads can access and modify the data structure simultaneously without causing data corruption.


2. **HashTable does not allow null keys or null values**, whereas **HashMap** allows *one null key* and *multiple null values.*  


Now, back to why I mentioned **'HashMap'** instead of **'HashTable'** :  

When you first start programming in Java, the code you write is typically non-concurrent (single-threaded). Also, **HashMap** was introduced after *Java 1.2*. Since I started programming in *Java 17*, I’m so accustomed to using **HashMap** over **HashTable** that I don't always consider the performance implications or the distinct differences between the two data structures.

## Implementating a Simple Hash Table 

Even though there are a number of ways to implement a hash table, the simplest implementation is to use an array of linked lists and a hash code function.

### Key Steps 

1. **Compute the hash code for the key**:
   - The key could be an `int` or `long` (both are number types in Java).
   - It's important to note that different keys can have the same hash code. This happens because, while there are many possible keys, the number of hash codes is limited (we use `int` values for hash codes).

2. **Map the hash code to an index in the array**:
   - Use a formula like `hash(key) % array_length` to get the index where the key-value pair should be stored.
   - Two different keys could end up mapping to the same index, which is called a collision.

3. **Store the key-value pair at that index**:
   - At this index, we use a linked list to store key-value pairs. This helps handle collisions, where either two keys have the same hash code or two different hash codes map to the same index.
   - By using a linked list, we can add new key-value pairs to the same index without losing the previous ones.

A good implementation of a hash table that keeps the collisions to a minimum has a lookup time of **O(1)**. In the worst-case scenario, i.e., when the number of collisions is very high, the lookup time is **O(N)**, where **N** is the number of keys.

### Code 

```java
class KeyValuePair {
    int key;
    String value;
    KeyValuePair next;

    KeyValuePair(int key, String value) {
        this.key = key;
        this.value = value;
    }
}

class HashTable {
    private static final int SIZE = 10;
    private KeyValuePair[] table;

    public HashTable() {
        table = new KeyValuePair[SIZE];
    }

    private int hash(int key) {
        return key % SIZE;
    }

    public void insert(int key, String value) {
        int index = hash(key);
        KeyValuePair newPair = new KeyValuePair(key, value);
        if (table[index] == null) {
            table[index] = newPair;
        } else {
            KeyValuePair current = table[index];
            while (current.next != null && current.key != key) {
                current = current.next;
            }
            if (current.key == key) {
                current.value = value; // Update value
            } else {
                current.next = newPair;
            }
        }
    }

    public String get(int key) {
        int index = hash(key);
        KeyValuePair current = table[index];
        while (current != null) {
            if (current.key == key) {
                return current.value;
            }
            current = current.next;
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

##  Implementating a Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST) Hash Table

The alternate method is to implement a balanced BST, where the lookup time is **O(log N)**.

### Advantages of a BST Implementation

1. **Less space usage**: As we no longer allocate a large array.
2. **Key ordering**: We can iterate through the keys in order, which can be useful at times.

### Code 

```java
class BSTNode {
    int key;
    String value;
    BSTNode left, right;

    BSTNode(int key, String value) {
        this.key = key;
        this.value = value;
        left = right = null;
    }
}

class BSTHashTable {
    private BSTNode root;

    public void insert(int key, String value) {
        root = insertRec(root, key, value);
    }

    private BSTNode insertRec(BSTNode node, int key, String value) {
        if (node == null) {
            return new BSTNode(key, value);
        }
        if (key < node.key) {
            node.left = insertRec(node.left, key, value);
        } else if (key > node.key) {
            node.right = insertRec(node.right, key, value);
        } else {
            node.value = value; // Update value
        }
        return node;
    }

    public String get(int key) {
        return getRec(root, key);
    }

    private String getRec(BSTNode node, int key) {
        if (node == null) {
            return null;
        }
        if (key < node.key) {
            return getRec(node.left, key);
        } else if (key > node.key) {
            return getRec(node.right, key);
        } else {
            return node.value;
        }
    }
}
```
