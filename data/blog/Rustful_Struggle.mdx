Advent of Code 2024 has been a rollercoaster ride for me. Starting with great enthusiasm, I set out to solve each puzzle in Rust, a language I’ve been learning and loving. However, this journey has humbled me more than I expected.

## Progress so Far

### Days Completed
- **Day 2**: Fully solved!
- **Day 3**: Fully solved!
- **Day 9**: Managed to figure it out after hours of debugging.

### Half-Way Through
- **Day 4**: Got halfway through but hit a roadblock.

### Yet to Solve
- The puzzles in between remain untouched, staring at me from the leaderboard like unscaled mountains.



## Struggles and Learnings

Advent of Code is supposed to be fun, but it has felt more like a test of endurance. Rust’s strictness, while its greatest strength, can also be its most frustrating feature for a learner. I often found myself spending more time battling the compiler than solving the puzzle.


## Looking Ahead

As of now, I’m considering taking a break from Advent of Code. This journey has taught me a lot, but it’s also shaken my confidence. Rust is an incredible language, but perhaps not the best companion for a high-pressure puzzle challenge.

To all those crushing AoC this year—hats off to you! And to those who, like me, are struggling—let’s remind ourselves that learning is a journey, not a race.

**Would I continue my journey tomorrow?**

Only time will tell.

Thank you for reading my musings on this turbulent adventure. Until next time!
